 	<h2>My Goals</h2>
	<p>I have been interested in web development since my sophmore year at CSU when I took an entry level computing class that touched on some basic coding. I really enjoy both the design side using HTML and CSS as well as using Javascript and other languages for more of the fuctionality and problem solving areas. After graduating from Galvanize, I would love to work for one of the many startups here in the Denver area. I also think if would be fun to design an app or website with my brother at some point.</p>
