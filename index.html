<h2>Just a little about me...</h2>
   
<p>  Hello everyone! My name is Marc and I grew up just down the road in Colorado Springs. I lived in the "Springs" until I graduated highschool at which point I moved to Fort Collins to attend CSU. Eventually I decided to split the difference between the two and made my way to Denver three years ago. I guess you could say I'm a lot like many other Coloradoans in the fact that I love the outdoors. During the winter I head up to the mountains every chance I get to ski. In the summer you can find me on the golf course, camping, hiking, biking, fishing or enjoying the weather on a patio. My parents still live in Colorado Springs along with the chubby lab in the photo with me and my sister is here in Denver, while my brother (who is a developer) lives in Bend, OR with his wife and my awesome niece. I'm super excited to be in the full-stack program here at Galvanize and can't wait to start learning.
